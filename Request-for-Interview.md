###### Interview with Spectra Group
Hi Ryan,

I was very disappointed to see that you withdrew your proposal on upwork. Both myself and two of my best guys were really excited to talk to you. If it was a timing issue, let's reschedule. Please feel free to reach out to me on discord or email (below). 

I think Amy, told you we were hiring starting at $15.00 per hour, but if you are as impressive in person as you are on paper, I'd love to talk you about bumping that up.    

Sincerely,
Jason Buchanan

P.S. We are working on some very exciting projects that include ML and blockchain, if you're excited about those things.
